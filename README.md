# ExcelCompareApp
A .NET Multiplatform App with UI which compares two Excel files for similarities and differences. 
It is cross-platform app which uses a single C# codebase implementation for Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows.

# How it works
The application consists of a simple interface to that accepts 2 Excel files. 
When the user uploads the 2 Excel files , it converts the files to stream and passes them to a file comparator logic which then gives a result.
Hashing techniques were used to compare hashvalues of rows between Excels files to detect similarities and differences.
